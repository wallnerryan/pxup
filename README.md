Bring up a Portworx cluster using Vagrant and libvirt based on docker. It also installs a minio server on each
node on port 7999 with access_key `admin` and secret_key `password`.

To use with sdk-test:

```yaml
cloudproviders:
  aws:
    CredName: "minio"
    CredType: "s3"
    CredRegion: "us-east-1"
    CredAccessKey: "admin"
    CredEndpoint: "NODEIPHERE:7999"
    CredSecretKey: "password"
    CredDisableSSL: "true"
```

# Usage

* One time setup: `./bootstrap.sh`
* Set the name of your image name in `global_vars.yaml` 

An etcd server will be setup in node0 and configured in config.json. If you would like your
own etcd server endpoints you can adjust `roles/common/files/config.json`.

### Build the cluster

* Run `./up.sh` and enjoy

### Redeploy

Once the system is running, to redeploy a new version type:

```
$ ./update.sh
```

# Infrastructure

To increase the number of nodes, disks, or memory edit the following values
in the Vagrantfile:

```
NODES = 3
DISKS = 3
MEMORY = 4096
CPUS = 2
```
